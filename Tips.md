# Apex Legends Tips, for Becca

## Basics

These are some basic things everybody does, and you'll be able to learn fairly quickly:

- *Reload as often as possible*. Kill someone? Reload. Fall back to heal? Reload. Rotating (moving) around the map? ***Reload***.
- *Keep an eye on your health*; I showed you how to select different heals, all that's left there is putting them to use.
- *Practice in the Firing Range before you play an actual match*; Aside from getting in some training and increasing your skill, it also helps you warm up before a real match.
  - When practicing, focus on the following things:
    - Recoil Control (preventing the gun from moving upwards as you fire)
    - Tracking (shooting at a moving target)
    - Strafing (move Left/Right while shooting at a target)
  - Try to avoid using attachments such as Barrels, Stocks, Laser Sights, etc. (Extended Mags are ok) as they decrease the difficulty of the weapon; If you can master the weapon with no help from attachments, you'll become a god *with* attachments.
  - For an extra challenge, you can change how the Dummies in the range work; Check the upper right corner of your screen when in the range for how.
- Holster your weapons whenever possible. This can be done by holding the button to swap weapons. Moving with your weapon out is slow, and holstering can be the difference between living and dying.
- Don't waste too much time looting. When playing with me this isn't an issue at all (I'll get us into a fight ready or not lmao), but when playing alone, loot quick. Grab some useable weapons, some ammo and heals, and then find someone to fight. You'll learn more from dying than you'll learn from looting.


## Settings

There are a few settings you should definitely adjust, mostly involving controller layout and sensitivity.

### Sensitivity
Sensitivity affects how much/little you need to move the Joysticks to move/look in-game. There are two layers to adjusting it
- Default Look Controls
- Advanced Look Controls (ALC)

By default, you can scale the sensitivity up for various aspects (Looking, Looking ADS, etc.), and I encourage you to increase it to something higher

Beyond that, you can delve into the fairly complicated "Advanced Look Controls". I personally wouldn't suggest messing with ALC unless you swap to a different button layout (dicussed below), and are interested in learning movement tech... in which case I'll ease you in to my crackhead ALC settings (500 Linear with 0% Deadzone is wonderful when you master it, but absolute hell to get used to).

### Button Layout
This one is really only for if you want to learn movement tech, which I don't even know if it's learnable on Switch due to the 70 FOV lock.
If you do though, I suggest the Ninja button layout. Zip Jumps on Ninja require right hand Claw grip, but that's the price of controller movement. Failing that, Bumper Jumper is a fairly good option.

## Inventory Management
This section may seem complicated, but it will quickly become second nature for you.

A good inventory should balance out Ammo, Heals, Grenades, and Utilities; While the exact inventory is subject to what you find in terms of loot, and what your playstyle is, there are a few rules that always apply:

- Maximum of 2 MedKits (1 stack) and 4 syringes (1 stack)
- Minimum of 8 Shield Cells (2 stacks) and 4 Shield Batteries (2 stacks)
These numbers are of course subject to Backpack size; Scale them down as needed to fit your backpack. 

The amount of ammo you need to carry differs for each weapon class:

- Light/Heavy: 240 (4 stacks)
- Energy 300 (5 stacks)
- Shotgun 16 (1 stack)
- Sniper 84 (3 stacks)

The reason not to carry more, is because you will rarely use that much ammo without killing an enemy, and looting more from their deathbox.

Grenades are optional, but you really shouldn't carry more than two. Arc Stars are typically the most useful to carry around, due to their high damage, stun, and ability to stick to objects and enemies.

What weapons you carry obviously influences your available space, as you'll want to make room for the right amount of ammo; With that being said, I encourage running 1 primary weapon that is Automatic or Burst with the appropriate ammo amount, and 1 Pistol/Shotgun/Sniper/Marksman as your secondary, that either uses the same ammo as your primary or else requires less ammo.

Some examples are provided below:

R-301 (Light AR) / Peacekeeper (Shotgun)

Wingman (Sniper Pistol) / R-99 (Light SMG)

Nemesis (Energy Burst AR) / Mastiff (Shotgun)

CAR (Heavy/Light SMG) / G7 Scout (Light Marksman)

Many more combinations can be made, but that's for you to discover. Note how the above examples complement each other in terms of how far they can shoot, damage dealt, and ammo needed.


### Notes

There are so so so many more things I could put here, but this is probably overwhelming enough. Hopefully it helps some, and makes Apex a little more enjoyable.
DM me with any questions you have about these tips or other Apex stuff; Aside from smaller changes from the past couple seasons, I know a concerning amount of stuff about Apex, and have nobody else to share it with lmao.
